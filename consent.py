<h2>What will happen if you take part in the study?</h2>
<p>If you agree to participate in this study, you will play two games of a browser-based implementation of Hanabi with an AI controlled player, and then answer some questions about your experience with the AI and board games in general.

After the conclusion of the study, the information we gathered will be released to the public to foster further research. Note that none of this information can be linked back to you personally, and that you can choose if you want to be included in the published data at the end of the experiment.
